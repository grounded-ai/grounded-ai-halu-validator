During this process, plants also release oxygen as a byproduct, which is essential for most life on Earth.

The information in DNA is stored as a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Human DNA consists of about 3 billion bases, and more than 99 percent of those bases are the same in all people. The order, or sequence, of these bases determines the information available for building and maintaining an organism, similar to the way in which letters of the alphabet appear in a certain order to form words and sentences.",

Each strand is made up of a sequence of four nucleotide bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). These bases pair specifically: A with T, and G with C. The sequence of these bases determines the genetic information. DNA's primary function is to store and transmit genetic information from one generation to the next.
